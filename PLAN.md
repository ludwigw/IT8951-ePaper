# Modernization and Portability Plan for IT8951-ePaper

## Status (June 2024)

- **Directory structure:** Modernized; all code in `src/`, headers in `include/`, examples in `examples/`, tests in `tests/`.
- **Documentation:** Doxygen and user docs complete and up to date.
- **Testing:** Automated tests for all modules, including hardware abstraction, fonts, GUI, and e-Paper driver. Mocks for hardware present.
- **Build system:**
  - Fully modern Makefile at project root.
  - Builds static library (`libit8951epd.a`) from all sources in `src/`.
  - Builds all example binaries from `examples/`.
  - Supports platform selection (`PLATFORM=BCM|LGPIO|GPIOD`).
  - All object and dependency files are uniquely named and mapped, regardless of source directory.
  - `make install` copies headers and library to `/usr/local`.
  - Documentation and clean targets included.
  - **Tested:** All build logic works as intended. The only build failures are due to missing system dependencies (e.g., `bcm2835.h` for BCM platform).

## System Dependencies

- **BCM platform:** Requires `bcm2835` development headers (`libbcm2835-dev` on Raspberry Pi OS).
- **LGPIO platform:** Requires `lgpio` development headers.
- **GPIOD platform:** Requires `gpiod` development headers.

## Next Steps

- [ ] Optional: Add CMake support for cross-platform builds.
- [ ] Optional: Add CI for automated builds/tests on all platforms.
- [ ] Optional: Add more example applications.

**The project is now ready for release, collaboration, and further development.**
