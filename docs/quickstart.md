# Quickstart: Displaying an Image on a WaveShare e-Paper Display

This guide will help you quickly get an image displayed on your WaveShare e-Paper device using a Raspberry Pi (including Pi Zero W2).

## ðŸš€ Quick Start: Display an Image in 3 Steps

### 1. Hardware Setup
- Connect your WaveShare e-Paper display to the Raspberry Pi according to the manufacturer's instructions.
- Ensure the SPI interface is enabled on your Pi.
- For Raspberry Pi 5, edit `/boot/config.txt`:
  - Comment out: `#dtparam=spi=on`
  - Add: `dtoverlay=spi0-0cs`
  - Reboot: `sudo reboot`

### 2. Build and Run
```sh
make bin/epdraw           # Build the CLI tool
./bin/epdraw image.bmp    # Display your image
```

### 3. That's it! 

The 'epdraw' CLI tool is the recommended way to use this library for image display.

**Optional parameters:**
```sh
./bin/epdraw image.bmp 2510 2    # Specify VCOM (-2.51V) and mode (GC16)
```

## Image Preparation

Convert your image to a compatible BMP format:

```sh
cd pic
./convert_to_eink.sh your_image.png
# This creates your_image.bmp
```

**Display modes:**
- `0`: No rotate, no mirroring (default)
- `1`: No rotate, X mirroring (10.3" e-Paper HAT)
- `2`: No rotate, X mirroring (5.2" e-Paper) - **Recommended**
- `3`: No rotate, no mirroring, color (6" color)

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the image does not display, check your wiring and SPI configuration.
- Ensure your BMP is 16-color grayscale and properly rotated.
- Try different modes if the image appears mirrored or rotated.
- See [troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md) for more help.
